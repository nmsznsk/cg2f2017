\textbf{Summary}
\newline

This article reviews the use of a virtual reality desktop environment for use within a working and research scenario. The physical hardware used is a head mounted display, hand tracking hardware attached to the headset, and regular office utilities such as a keyboard, monitor, etc., with the goal of allowing users to plug/unplug the headset and use as needed. When using the application, the user will see a virtual table, monitor, keyboard and mouse, and the user remains seated. When within the application, the user will see a node-link diagram (various spheres with links in between each, forming a web), and can utilize hand-based gestures to perform various actions and commands. By doing so, the user will be immersed in the data, and may be able to achieve a better understanding by reviewing within this new perspective. Currently, all of this is configured as a prototype for the team's "DeskVR" application, so more features are being implemented to help streamline the use of virtual reality within a normal workspace, but it seems promising so far.
