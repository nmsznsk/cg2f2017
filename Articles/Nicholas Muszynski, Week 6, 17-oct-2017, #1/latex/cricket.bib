Abstract = {The basis of this research is concerned with designing and implementing a system that allows a player to engage in a virtual reality (VR) game with better immersion. The research was based on the idea that an avatar generated using real-time motion capture would improve the player’s immersion by increasing the perception of presence. When playing the VR games a common problem was observed. The user’s avatar (Virtual agent) was not improved as most of the games were played using limited controllers. The inputs from these controllers were noted as insufficient to generate the entire body’s animation. This research attempts to solve this problem by proposing/implementing full body motion capture and the establishment of the self-avatar in real time in a VR game. This involved designing a system that utilizes the effective technologies for 3D imaging, transmission and haptic feedback. The research attempts to measure the immersion by enhancing measuring instruments (Norman, 2010). It is c},
