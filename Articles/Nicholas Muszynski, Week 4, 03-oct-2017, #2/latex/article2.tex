\textbf{Summary}
\newline

In this journal, 7 articles were selected out of a pool of 18 to review new possible data and applications for haptics.\\
"`Scenario-Based Observation Approach for Eliciting User Requirements for Haptic User Interfaces"' - This study reviewed current processes for requirements engineering, and proposed a methodology which focused heavily on context based on scenario, and tested the theory with visually impaired students.\\
"`VITAKI: A Vibrotactile Prototyping Toolkit for Virtual Reality and Video Games"' - A new toolkit was created which enables prototyping for new vibrotactile interaction techniques.\\
"`Haptics on a Touch Screen: Characterization of Perceptual Thresholds"' - This study tested user sensitivity to vibration on touch screens by varying the wavelengths and intensities of the vibration.\\
"`The Effect of Vision on Discrimination of Compliance Using a Tool"' - This group studied user perceptions of compliance based on varying combinations of vision and haptics, such as direct (vision + haptics), indirect (view via computer screen + haptics), or just with haptics on its own.\\
"`Use of Reference Frame and Movement Pattern in Haptically Enhanced 3D Virtual Environment"' - This study had visually impaired users describe a mental map of an environment they were tasked with walking through, and what factors assist in this endeavor.\\
"`The Impact of Combining Kinesthetic and Facial Expression Displays on Emotion Recognition by Users"' - This article determined how much importance haptics may have for recognizing facial expressions, but testing appeared to have inconclusive results.\\
"`Intermodal Audio-Haptic Metaphor: Improvement of Target Search in Abstract Environments"' - Audio and haptics were paired together to determine how well participants would be able search for a target in a complex environment.
