Abstract = {Understanding physical phenomena is still a challenging task. Three-dimensional interactive simulations are a valuable tool to support understanding. We implemented different physical simulations designed so that students can interact and learn with them. However, student engagement is crucial to support the learning process. Virtual reality applications offer a promising way to engage and immerse students in three-dimensional environments and to keep them focused on the learning task. In this paper, we explore interactive virtual reality experiences implemented with HTC Vive as an alternative form of learning tool supporting engagement and to support the ability to concentrate better on the learning tasks. We ran a two-fold user study in which 19 students evaluated the experience looking at engagement, motivation, usability, and learning. First results indicate that such experiences are well suited as a supplement to traditional in-class learning and that they support realistic labor},
