Abstract = {To improve the motion efficiency of the rescue detection robot under the environment of disasters in coal mine, Virtual Reality (VR) technology was used to build the Remote Control System (RCS) in this paper. By using virtual simulation technology to achieve the intuitive expression the position, orientation and surrounding of rescue detection robot, combining dynamic modeling technology to reconstruct the rescue zone, the RCS based on VR makes information consistent between VR surroundings and reality environment. The modules and their functions of the RCS based on VR are introduced, the basic theories and methods are presented as well. A VR-based RCS system and the rescue detection robot is built under laboratory conditions. The motion control subsystem, the precise localization subsystem and the dynamic modeling subsystem are integrated into the system. System function and partial performance test are completed. The results shows that these methods can collect and display the infor},
