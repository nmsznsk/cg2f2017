Abstract = {There is a trend that VR contents using Head Mounted Displays(HMDs) get highlighted these days. However, most of users suffer from the difficulties in use of VR contents due to motion sickness. In this paper, definition, causes and solutions for the motion sickness will be investigated. To resolve the motion sickness problem, this paper will propose the test system which allows users to prevent motion sickness at the time when VR contents are produced and take a close look at the architecture of the system.},
