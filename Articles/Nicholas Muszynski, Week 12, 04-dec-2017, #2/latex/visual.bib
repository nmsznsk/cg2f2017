Abstract = {Creating a virtual reality (VR) by combining visual information and pseudo touch sensing is studied actively. However, being strictly detached from visual information, it is not easy for visually impaired individuals to sense a visual VR world. The purpose of our study is the development of, so we call, haptic VR technologies for aiding visually impaired individuals sense his (her) surroundings and recognize geometric constructions in the space. Our haptic VR system for the cane walk is installed as follows: in the VR world we put (draw) a cane and a hand with its 5 fingers holding the cane. In real word, we wear a data glove on one hand and this hand is superposed on the virtual hand (this is achieved by each finger being force provided through the data-glove). Thus our VR sensing is created by the pseudo haptic sensing at the fingers for which the feedback forces are provided by the data-glove worn on the hand. In our haptic VR space of cane walk, we have prepared "studded paving bl},
