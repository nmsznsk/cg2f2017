Current status in the project:

- After determining that my computer doesn't appear to be compatible with the Oculus Rift, I am now basing my project upon Gear VR instead.

- Ensuring that I am able to successfully package projects to my phone (this is almost complete, I can successfully package to my phone but run into sporadic errors, currently trying to iron this out).

- Ensure that my phone is compatible with Gear VR (tested and confirmed this with apps from the Oculus store, was able to successfully play several titles).

- Implement a barebones environment which utilizes head movement to control the camera (this is the next step, I don't want to start working on the contents of the project until the deployment process has been stabilized. I expect this to be implemented by the end of the week).



Backup plan:

- If I am unable to reliably deploy projects to my phone, I may switch over to a different IDE instead. I am currently using Unreal Engine 4, but will attempt to switch to Unity if deployment issues continue to stall progress.
