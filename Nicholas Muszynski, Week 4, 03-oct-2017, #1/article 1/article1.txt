Effects of 3D Virtual Haptics Force Feedback
on Brand Personality Perception:
The Mediating Role of Physical Presence in Advergames


Novint Falcon haptics system
tested how sensory and cognitive dimensions are affected based on intensity of forced feedback settings

tactile stimuli - feeling as if something is there
cognitive dimension - acknowledging as if something is there

users exposed to force feedback felt stronger physical presence than those in the no force feedback condition

Haptics is defined as ‘the modality of touch and associated sensory feedback.’

Physical presence refers to ‘‘a psychological state in which
virtual physical objects are experienced as actual physical
objects.’’4(p44) Physical presence occurs when technology users
do not notice either the para-authentic or artificial nature of
mediated objects, environments, or simulated objects.

argument:
People who are exposed to haptics stimuli with force
feedback will feel stronger physical presence than those
exposed to haptics stimuli without force feedback.

it was also noted that the time they drove with feedback enabled led test users to believe that the brand of the car was more rugged than the car that they drove without the feedback.


Participants in the haptics stimuli with force
feedback condition test-drove the car using the Novint Falcon
device, which was set up to produce force feedback. In order
to maximize the effects of force feedback manipulation,
terrain effects, acceleration, and lateral forces were set at the
maximum level. In contrast, participants in the haptics stimuli
without force feedback condition test-drove the car using
the Novint Falcon device but were not given any force feedback
stimuli.


was determined that force-feedback had significant impacts on physical presence
